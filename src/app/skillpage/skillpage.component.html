  The aim was to create a strong and wide knowledge base so I could have a better idea of what career path I'd like to take and also become more
  confident with using unfamiliar technologies. Overall, learning these skills has been quite enjoyable for me and I'm looking to further
   specialise and learn more as I progress in my career."></app-title>
